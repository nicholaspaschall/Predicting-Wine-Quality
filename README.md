# Predicting Wine Quality

The focus of this project is to employ several machine learning techniques to assess the qualities of red and white wine.

Detailed information regarding the techniques and processes used can be found in the **Wine Quality Analysis Report**. This report includes data cleaning and descriptive statistics, feature selection with recursive feature elimination, machine learning models (cross-validation, multiple linear regression, regression tree, random forest, gradient boosting), and final conclusions.
